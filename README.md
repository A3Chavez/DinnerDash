## How it works
<p>Customer is first prompted to select if they wish to login into their account or continue as a guest.</p>

<p>When a customer attempts to log into an account that doesn't exist, an error message will pop up and prompt the 
user that a new account will be made. Next, the customer will be prompted to enter their payment information to be attached to the account.</p>

<p>The customer may select the items they wish to purchase and the shopping cart will be update each time a new item is selected.</p>

<p>Once the customer selects "Place Order," a popup window will ask if the customer wants to pick-up their food or have it delivered. 
If the customer is logged in, selecting the Pick-Up option will display the time the food will be ready and the Delivery option will 
ask for a delivery address before displaying the delivery time. If the customer is a guest, the payment window will appear before displaying 
the respective windows mentioned for the logged in customer.</p>
